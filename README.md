# ball-bouncing-game

This is a game for two players: one player controls the right paddle using arrow keys, the other player controls the left paddle using "W" and "S". If you miss a ball, the other player will win a score.
Once the ball hit one side of the paddles, it will increase its speed slightly to make it a little bit more challenging.
If the ball goes out of bounds at the edge of the screen, the ball will be reseted to the inital position to the center of the screen, and moving toward the other player instead.
